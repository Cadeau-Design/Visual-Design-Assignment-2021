       <h1>Christ, the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ and the most iconic image of Rio de Janeiro.</h1> 
       
      
       <h2>1) The Real Christ</h2>
       <p>The statue of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)">Christ, the Redeemer</a>, symbolises Rio de Janeiro and it is widely recognised as one of the biggest <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco">Art Deco</a> statues of its kind and as I am experimenting with nostalgia, I am manipulating it, by using different colours and applying the concept of <a class="link" href="https://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm">complementary and analogous colours</a>.  </p>
      <p> The original image was download from <a class="link" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/corcovado-christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-4682545">Shutterstock</a>, which I have imported to Photoshop. For this work, I have selected the subject, in this case, the Christ, by using the 'Object Selection Tool' and then I have manipulated the colour balance by experimenting with the mid tones.</p> 
      <p>Once I was happy with the result of the image I have exported it as a 'Save for Web (legacy)'.</p>

          <h2>2) Christ, The Redeemer as pop art</h2>
          <p> In this section, continuing with the theme of nostalgia, I was inspired by the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art">Pop Art</a> movement that emerged during the 1950s.</p>
          <p> I have drawn inspiration, specifically, from the work that Andy Warhol did with images of the iconic American actress <a class="link" href="https://revolverwarholgallery.com/portfolio/marilyn-monroe-portfolio/">Marilyn Monroe.</a></p>
          <p> I have selected the subject, in this case, the Christ, by using the 'Object Selection Tool', then copy the selection into a new canvas, then manipulating the background colour and Christ's colour itself.</p>
          <p> I have then applied colours based on the <a class="link" href="https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory">colour theory</a>, experimenting with the analogous and complimentary colours. My main aim in this experiment was to understand how colours can compliment themselves or shock the audience with different vibrant colours.</p>

    <h2 id="Heading-2">3) Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro and its pavement </h2>
    <p> <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copacabana,_Rio_de_Janeiro">Copacabana</a> is perhaps the most iconic neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, it is also a 'Balneario' beach which stretches for 4 km (2.5 miles).</p>
    <p> The promenade is parallel to the Beach and its zigzag wave pattern is fashioned from black and white tiles designed by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Burle_Marx">Roberto Burle Marx</a> in 1970 who was inspired by the 'calçadas Portuguesas' widely seen in Lisbon, especially in the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossio"> Rossio Square</a>.</p>
    <p> For this experiment, I have downloaded the images from Shutterstock and imported them into Photoshop. By using a different range of tools, such as 'Quick Selection Tool' and 'Magic Wand Tool', I was then able to select different parts of the image and apply the colour balance adjustment option. By doing this, I was able to adjust the colour balance and temperature of the light exposure in the image. </p>
    <p>My main aim with this experiment was to manipulate the image and create a feeling of 'hot' and 'cold' temperatures, enhance shadows and apply a stronger contrast between colours.  </p>

    <h2>4) Cais das Colunas, Lisbon </h2>
    <p>The <a class="link" href="https://www.lisbon-id.com/p5987-cais-das-colunas.html">Cais das Colunas</a> is located at the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pra%C3%A7a_do_Com%C3%A9rcio">Praça do Comércio</a>, central Lisbon, on the famous <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagus">Tagus River</a>. This is a place of peace and beauty, where people gather to enjoy the sun and the waterfront.</p>
    <p>It reminds me of my home country, Brazil, and especially the historic parts of Rio de Janeiro, which was the home to the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_the_Portuguese_court_to_Brazil">Portuguese Royal family</a> from 1808 until 1821, when the Portuguese King went back to Portugal.</p>
    <p> Therefore, the two cities, Rio de Janeiro and Lisbon have a lot of similarities, such as architecture and urbanisation which was heavily developed during the period that Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the Kingdom of Portugal.</p>
    <p>As Cais das Colunas has a special place in my memories when I visit Lisbon, I wanted to include them as an image in this project, as another symbol of nostalgia and melancholy.</p> 
    <p> For this part of the experiment, I have followed the same technique that I used for part three of the <a class="link" href="#Heading-2">Image Portfolio</a>, I downloaded the images from Shutterstock and imported them into Photoshop. By using a different range of tools, such as 'Quick Selection Tool' and 'Magic Wand Tool', I was then able to select different parts of the image and apply the colour balance adjustment option. By doing this, I was able to adjust the colour balance and temperature of the light exposure in the image. </p>
    <p>My main aim with this experiment was also to play with colours, enhance shadows and apply different colours from the original image.  </p>
